　　**Ray-MMD Reforge** is a modified fork of the original Ray-MMD library for [mikumikudance](http://www.geocities.jp/higuchuu4/index_e.htm).
　　Focused on bridging realistic lighting with stylized rendering, Reforge rebuilds the engine pipeline around direct, high-precision screen-space raymarching and ultrafast root-finding algorithms. On top of it sit modern graphics techniques: **Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)**, **Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI)**, **Hybrid HBAO/SSDO**, and the **AgX tone mapper** — for a stable, physically grounded image out of the box.

Requirement :
------------
* [MikuMikuDance](http://www.geocities.jp/higuchuu4/index_e.htm) - 926ver (x64) (Without Anti-Aliasing)
* [MikuMikuEffect](https://bowlroll.net/file/35012) - 037ver (x64)
* Direct3D 9 With Shader Model 3.0 (ps_3_0)
* **Powerful GPU recommended** due to advanced shading techniques.

Reforge Exclusive Features (through v1.20.22) :
------------

**Direct Screen-Space Core**
* **Direct 1:1 Screen-Space Architecture**: eliminated the heavy 11-pass hierarchical depth pyramid (Hi-Z) from the deferred core, freeing 11 RenderTarget textures in VRAM and removing per-frame downsampling passes in favor of direct G-buffer raymarching, 2D DDA, and Newton root-finding. Hi-Z acceleration is retained only where it pays for itself: the SSR tracer (`SSR_HiZ.fxsub`).
* **Octahedral Normal Encoding**: compact and high-precision octahedral representation for unit normal vectors in G-buffer and math pipelines.

**Global Illumination (SSPT / RTGI & SSGI 3.0)**
* **Screen-Space Path Tracing (SSPT / RTGI 3.0 - `GI_ENABLE 3`, Default)**: next-generation path-traced room radiance engine inspired by Marty McFly's qUINT RTGI. Implements low-discrepancy Monte Carlo cosine-weighted hemisphere path tracing with golden angle rotation (`SSPT_GOLDEN_ANGLE = 2.39996323`), 1D Bayer dither stratification, and projected-axis orthonormal tangent frame (`BuildTangentMatrix`).
* **Static Frozen Ray Dithering & À-Trous Spatial Denoising**: per-pixel dither pattern is frozen across frames (no temporal flicker), so all stochastic noise is fully absorbed by the bilateral blur chain — GI output is clean without any temporal accumulation, history buffers, or ghost-trail risk.
* **Progressive Quadratic Ray Stepping & Depth Thickness Gating**: dense near-field precision with broad room reach (`lambda = s * sqrt(s)`), analytical depth thickness gating (`delta = (pSample - pRay) * invThickness`) preventing light leaking through walls, fingers, and hair.
* **Secondary Bounce Feedback & Viewport-Boundary Radiance**: multi-bounce reflection feedback loop (`SSPT_BOUNCES 1`) with emissive transfer and escaped-ray sky radiance sampling preventing dark camera-edge halos.
* **Deferred Ambient Occlusion Post-GI Composite**: deferred SSDO execution and introduced a dedicated post-GI pass (`Shader/PostProcessAOComposite.fxsub`) running after `SSGIFinalCombine`. Uniformly applies Jimenez multi-bounce AO across total composited radiance (direct + IBL + GI), preventing strong indirect bounces from bleaching contact shadows and crevices while preserving clean glass and emissive passthrough.
* **Direct Solar Shadow Retention & Sky Radiance Calibration**: direct shadow gating (`SSPT_SHADOW_RETENTION 0.60`) in SSPT and SSGI resolves scaling indirect bounce against `ShadowMapSamp` via a quadratic penumbra response curve, keeping cast shadows deep and distinct without losing rich color bleeding. Replaced hardcoded unoccluded ray sky radiance with tunable `SSPT_SKY_LIGHT_AMOUNT 0.05` in `SSPT_Trace.fxsub`.
* **Albedo-Driven Dynamic Skin Multi-Bounce & Linearized Cavity AO**: dynamic albedo interreflection curve (`1.0 + (mat.albedo * 2.2) / max(...)`) and softened linear cavity AO in SSPT/SSGI resolves, eliminating skin darkening and crushing in deep shadows.
* **Dielectric Glass Resolve Bypass & Raymarch Transmission**: early-exit zero diffuse GI combine on `SHADINGMODELID_GLASS` preventing milky/matte fogging, and raymarch hit skipping (`continue`) allowing rays to transmit through glass without false bounce or artificial shadows.
* **SSGI 3.0 (`GI_ENABLE 1 / 2`)**: Duff (2017) branchless orthonormal basis, stratified Halton (2, 3) sampling, per-pixel IGN rotation, analytical screen-edge clipping (`ClipRayToScreenEdge`), and early thickness evaluation.
* **Dyadic À-Trous Cross-Bilateral Denoising**: two-pass edge-preserving filter with $5 \times 5$ Karis 0.20 outlier rejection, `[loop]` SM 3.0 instruction optimization, and tangent-plane distance weights (`BilateralPlaneWeight`).
* **Unified Quality Presets (`GI_QUALITY 1..4`)**: shared presets across SSGI and SSPT from Low (12 steps / 4 rays) to Cinematic (16 steps / 16 rays).
* **Rough Specular GI (`SSGI_SPECULAR_GI 1`)**: Fresnel-weighted indirect specular reflections on rough surfaces, with calibrated subtle sheen on skin (`0.25f`).

**Reflections & Occlusion**
* **Hierarchical-Z Screen-Space Reflections**: SSR ray tracing rebuilt on a min/max depth pyramid (`Shader/SSR/SSR_HiZ.fxsub`) — per-level mips packed into a single atlas texture, coarse-to-fine 2D DDA cell traversal with analytical depth jumps, adaptive thickness budgeting (`max(thickness, 0.4 + cellDepthSpan)`), and smooth confidence weights (grazing-angle, distance, depth fade) instead of hard clip rejection. Reflections run to the frame boundary without edge vignetting; radiance is point-sampled at the hit with NaN/Inf rejection. For true mirror-floor reflections of off-screen and semi-transparent content, external planar-reflection effects such as WorkingFloorX are recommended on top (disable ray SSR per-material via `SSR visibility 0.0.fx`).
* **Per-Material Reflection Mask System (4 dedicated MME tabs)**: `SSRMap` (receiver — how much a surface reflects), `SSRReflectMap` (source — how strongly a surface appears in other surfaces' reflections, `Shadow/SSR reflect visibility 0.0–1.0.fx`), `SSRSelfMap` (self-suppression — flagged materials never bounce SSR between each other, `Shadow/SSR self visibility 0.0–1.0.fx`), and `SSRBlurMap` (receiver blur mask — selective roughness boost per subset/material, `Shadow/SSR blur 0.0–1.0.fx`). All masks are preset-driven constants with nothing clipped, work on additive/semi-transparent materials, and never conflict across tabs.
* **Material-Driven SSR Roughness**: SSR blur now follows each material's own smoothness (smoothness maps / MMD shininess) via a perceptual `pow(roughness, 1.5)` pyramid-LOD mapping, consistent with the IBL specular response; global gloss bias tunable via `mSSRSmoothnessDefault` in `ray_advanced.conf`.
* **Stabilized Thin & Curved Glass Refraction**: view-space normal-tilt screen-space offset eliminating planar background object duplication on flat windows, physical thin-glass default (`customA = 0.5`), balanced chromatic dispersion, deflection clamping, and Newton's method 3D root-finding (Mayer et al. 2026).
* **Top-Down Sky Visibility & Heightfield Macro AO**: Snowdrop Engine (GDC 2016) directional horizon search and cone-tracing macro ambient occlusion preventing outdoor skylight and ambient IBL from leaking into covered spaces, under canopies, bridges, roofs, and doorways. Controlled via dedicated `SkyVisibilityController.pmx`.
* **Ground-Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO / GTSO)**: reference XeGTAO cosine horizon integration, Jimenez multi-bounce approximation, temporal history stabilization, and directional bent normals.
* **Hybrid HBAO / SSDO**: horizon-based and directional occlusion for accurate contact shading.
* **Contact Shadows**: screen-space contact shadows with depth-discontinuity artifact fixes and continuous penetration-based penumbra.

**Lighting & Shadows**

#### Skin SSS Separable Blur — `Shader/PostProcessScattering.fxsub`
* **Separable Screen-Space SSS (13-tap two-pass)**: horizontal + vertical convolution of the SSR-denoised diffusion field with a front-to-back modulated footprint and perspective-aware step — J. Jimenez et al. 2015, "Separable Subsurface Scattering" \[[link](https://www.iryoku.com/sssss/)\].
* **Christensen–Burley Approximate Reflectance Profiles**: 13-tap RGB kernel weights pre-integrated from the Burley-Normalized BSSRDF for two profiles (skin d=(1.9, 1.2, 0.8) mm; subsurface d=(2.4, 1.5, 0.9) mm) — P. Christensen & B. Burley, "Approximate Reflectance Profiles for Efficient Subsurface Scattering", Pixar Technical Memo 15-04 \[[link](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ApproxBSSRDF/)\].
* **Deferred SSS recombine & tint**: second-pass albedo tint (`sqrt(saturate(albedo))`, strength 0.35) and detail-preservation blend for low-scatter subsurface materials — the industry-standard recombine pattern from the separable SSS screen-space pipeline.
* **Absorption-aware bilateral edge guard**: per-channel depth tolerance modulated by the squared-albedo transport approximation so bright pixels scatter wider and dark pixels cut bleeding — adapted from ikeno's `ikPolishShader` sss.fxsub.
